      "Sample: Based on the information provided, Aidan would likely answer the question by guessing and choosing (b) TNF-Alpha. This is because TNF-Alpha is a protein that is involved in the immune system and autoimmune diseases, and modern monoclonal antibody therapy targets this protein to treat such conditions. While Aidan may not have a high level of medical knowledge, he may have heard of TNF-Alpha in the context of autoimmune diseases and associate it with modern monoclonal antibody therapy.\n",
