    "context = \"\"\"Elizabeth Harding, born in 1500 in the rural countryside of England, is a figure deeply entrenched in the tapestries of early Tudor England. Growing up in a modest farming family, Elizabeth's life has been shaped by the agrarian rhythms of sowing and harvesting. Her education, typical for a woman of her time and station, was minimal, focusing mainly on domestic skills essential for managing a household. She learned to spin wool, cook, and tend to livestock, but her literacy was limited to basic reading, a skill not commonly bestowed upon women of her era.Her life, however, was not confined to the domestic sphere alone. The early 16th century was a period of religious and political upheaval. The reign of Henry VIII saw dramatic changes, especially with the King's challenge to the Catholic Church, leading to the English Reformation. Elizabeth, like many of her contemporaries, found herself caught in the tides of these changes. Her family, staunchly Catholic, grappled with the shifting religious landscape, often discussing the latest decrees from the King that shook the foundations of their faith. In 1525, Elizabeth married Thomas Barton, a blacksmith, thereby entering a slightly higher social stratum. Their union, arranged by their families, was typical of the time, prioritizing social and economic considerations over romantic ones. Together, they navigated the complexities of Tudor society, experiencing both the challenges of rural life and the reverberations of decisions made in the distant courts of London.\n",
