I believe this because it's a common trait among many animals to seek out high places to rest and sleep, such as birds building nests in treetops or monkeys swinging from vines in rainforest canopies. It makes sense that Zarpies, being an alien species, would also have this instinct to find a safe and secure place to rest.\n",

The researcher mentioned that a lot of Zarpies have stripes on the bottom of their feet, which suggests that they might be more comfortable in trees. However, the researcher did not say that all Zarpies sleep in tall trees, so it is possible that some Zarpies prefer other types of shelter. Additionally, the presence of spots on a Zarpie's tongue and a star behind their horns were not mentioned as being particularly common among Zarpies who sleep in tall trees. Therefore, option (b) seems like the most likely answer based on the information provided. \n",

Based on what you told me about Zarpies, I think this Zarpie will sleep in a dog bed, like the dog mom, because it has spent its whole life around dogs and has never known another Zarpie. This Zarpie might not know how to sleep in tall trees or might not be comfortable doing so, since it is not what it is used to.
