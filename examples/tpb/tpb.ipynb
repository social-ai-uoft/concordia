      "2. (Value: 8, Likelihood: 70) - The break could allow Alice to recharge and come back to the experiment with renewed energy and motivation.\n",
      "3. (Value: 10, Likelihood: 50) - Taking a break might help Alice avoid feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the experiment, which could lead to a more positive experience.\n",
