      "2. **Emotional stress**: The added pressure of handling the move on her own can cause Dorothy to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated, leading to emotional distress. (Value: -8, Likelihood: 50)\n",
      "3. **Potential damage or loss**: Without proper assistance, Dorothy may accidentally damage or lose some of her belongings during the move, causing financial losses and stress. (Value: -9, Likelihood: 20)\n",

      "Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",

      "Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",

The recognition and praise from her peers and teachers boosted her confidence in her abilities and solidified her interest in engineering.\n",
      "[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] At 16 years old, Dorothy landed her first internship at a local manufacturing firm, where she worked alongside experienced engineers to design and build a prototype for a new product line. She was thrilled by the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and appreciated the mentorship of her colleagues.\n",

      "2. **Ask Alice for help**: Since Alice is already present and willing to listen, Dorothy could ask her friend for assistance in moving her belongings. This would also provide an opportunity for some social support and emotional validation.\n",
      "3. **Look for alternative help**: With Bob not showing up, Dorothy might need to find another solution to get the help she needs. She could try contacting other friends or acquaintances who might be available to lend a hand.\n",
      "4. **Try to manage on her own**: Given her medium level of aggression, Dorothy might feel frustrated by Bob's absence and decide to handle the move independently. This would require some problem-solving skills and physical effort, but it could also be a way for her to prove to herself that she can cope with unexpected setbacks.\n",
      "5. **Reach out to other resources**: If Dorothy is unable or unwilling to ask Alice or others for help, she might consider using professional moving services or online resources to find temporary storage solutions or transportation options.\n",
