      "Alice grew up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and vast fields of wheat. As a child, she was always fascinated by the way things worked, taking apart toys and appliances to understand their inner mechanics. This curiosity led her to pursue a career as an engineer, designing innovative solutions for sustainable energy. Her typical day was filled with meetings, brainstorming sessions, and tinkering in her workshop. Alice's medium level of responsibility drove her to take ownership of projects, ensuring they were completed on time and within budget. She was respected by her colleagues for her pragmatic approach and creative problem-solving skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she navigated her 30s and 40s, Alice's aspirations shifted from professional accolades to personal fulfillment. She began volunteering at a local community center, teaching young girls about science and technology. This work brought her immense joy, as she witnessed the spark of curiosity ignite in her students' eyes. Her friends and family admired her dedication to empowering the next generation of women in STEM fields. Alice's medium level of aggression manifested in her unwavering commitment to her causes, never backing down from a challenge or difficult conversation. She was afraid of failing those who depended on her, but this fear fueled her determination to make a positive impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, as Alice returned home from work, she found Dorothy waiting anxiously at her doorstep. Her friend urgently needed help moving out of her house that very night, and Alice didn't hesitate. She dropped everything, rallying her friends and family to assist with the relocation. As they worked through the night, Alice's sense of responsibility and duty shone bright. This moment encapsulated her life story: a balance of professional pursuits, personal passions, and unwavering commitment to those she cared about. In her twilight years, Alice looked back on a life filled with purpose, knowing that her legacy would inspire future generations to strive for a better world.When Alice was 6 years old, she spent hours building an intricate cardboard box fort with her siblings. As they worked together, Alice took charge, ensuring each piece fit perfectly and assigning tasks to her brothers and sisters. In the end, their collaborative effort resulted in a sturdy, imaginative structure that became a beloved play space.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice was 9 years old, she accidentally broke her mother's favorite vase while trying to fix it. Fearing punishment, Alice confessed to her mistake and offered to help pay for a replacement by doing extra chores. Her honesty and willingness to take responsibility impressed her parents, who instead used the opportunity to teach Alice about forgiveness and the value of apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice was 13 years old, she participated in her school's science fair, creating a project that showcased innovative ways to conserve water. As she presented her findings to the judges, Alice's passion for sustainability shone through, earning her first prize in the competition. This triumph sparked a sense of pride and motivation to continue pursuing her interests in STEM fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice was 16 years old, she volunteered at a local animal shelter, helping care for abandoned pets. During one particularly chaotic afternoon, Alice took initiative, directing her fellow volunteers to ensure every animal received proper attention. Her leadership and quick thinking prevented a potentially disastrous situation from unfolding.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice was 21 years old, she faced a difficult decision regarding which college to attend. After much contemplation, Alice chose the university that offered a prestigious engineering program, although it meant moving farther away from her family. This choice demonstrated her commitment to pursuing her academic goals and willingness to take calculated risks to achieve them.\n",

      "When Dorothy was 6 years old, she helped her mother care for a injured bird that had fallen from its nest. She carefully fed it and kept it warm, feeling a sense of responsibility towards this tiny creature. As she watched it heal and eventually fly away, Dorothy felt a surge of joy and pride in having made a difference.\n",
      "When Dorothy was 9 years old, she stood up for a classmate who was being bullied on the playground. She firmly told the bully to leave her friend alone, and when the teacher intervened, Dorothy explained what had happened. Her bravery earned her respect from her peers, and she realized that speaking up for others was important.\n",
      "When Dorothy was 13 years old, she volunteered at a local animal shelter, helping to care for stray cats and dogs. She worked tirelessly, even on weekends, and soon became known as the \"animal whisperer\" among the volunteers. This experience solidified her desire to pursue a career in healthcare.\n",
      "When Dorothy was 16 years old, she took it upon herself to help her elderly neighbor with grocery shopping every week. Mrs. Johnson had broken her hip, and Dorothy saw an opportunity to make a difference in someone's life. As they chatted while walking home from the store, Dorothy learned about Mrs. Johnson's life, and their conversations became a highlight of her week.\n",

      "[03 Jul 1990 00:00:00] When Dorothy was 6 years old, she helped her mother care for a injured bird that had fallen from its nest. She carefully fed it and kept it warm, feeling a sense of responsibility towards this tiny creature. As she watched it heal and eventually fly away, Dorothy felt a surge of joy and pride in having made a difference.\n",
      "[03 Jul 1993 00:00:00] When Dorothy was 9 years old, she stood up for a classmate who was being bullied on the playground. She firmly told the bully to leave her friend alone, and when the teacher intervened, Dorothy explained what had happened. Her bravery earned her respect from her peers, and she realized that speaking up for others was important.\n",
      "[03 Jul 1997 00:00:00] When Dorothy was 13 years old, she volunteered at a local animal shelter, helping to care for stray cats and dogs. She worked tirelessly, even on weekends, and soon became known as the \"animal whisperer\" among the volunteers. This experience solidified her desire to pursue a career in healthcare.\n",
      "[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] When Dorothy was 16 years old, she took it upon herself to help her elderly neighbor with grocery shopping every week. Mrs. Johnson had broken her hip, and Dorothy saw an opportunity to make a difference in someone's life. As they chatted while walking home from the store, Dorothy learned about Mrs. Johnson's life, and their conversations became a highlight of her week.\n",
      "[03 Jul 2005 00:00:00] When Dorothy was 21 years old, she organized a charity event at her college, raising funds for a local children's hospital. She spent countless hours planning and coordinating with her team, and on the day of the event, they exceeded their fundraising goal. As she looked out at the crowd of supporters, Dorothy felt an overwhelming sense of pride and fulfillment.\n",

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",
