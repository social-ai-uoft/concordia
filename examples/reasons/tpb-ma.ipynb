      "1. **Call Bob again**: Despite Bob's no-show earlier, Dorothy might still try to reach out to him one more time to see if he can help her move at this late hour.\n",
      "2. **Ask Alice for help**: Since Alice has already arrived home and is available, Dorothy could ask her friend for assistance with the move, considering it's an emergency situation.\n",
      "3. **Look for alternative help**: With no Bob in sight, Dorothy might try to find another acquaintance or neighbor who can lend a hand with the move, even if it means asking someone at short notice.\n",
      "4. **Take charge and do it herself**: Given her medium level of aggression, Dorothy might decide to take matters into her own hands and handle the move by herself, possibly feeling frustrated that Bob didn't show up as planned.\n",
      "5. **Postpone the move**: If all else fails, Dorothy could consider postponing the move to another day when she has more time and resources to deal with the situation, rather than trying to rush through it at this late hour.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Negative Consequences**\n",
      "\n",
