      "**Positive Consequences:**\n",

      "1. **Sense of Control**: By taking action, Dorothy can regain a sense of control over her situation, which can boost her confidence and mood. (Value: 8, Likelihood: 80)\n",
      "2. **Efficient Move**: By starting to pack and prepare, Dorothy can ensure a more efficient move, reducing the likelihood of last-minute chaos or forgotten items. (Value: 7, Likelihood: 90)\n",
      "3. **Reduced Stress**: Taking proactive steps can help reduce Dorothy's stress levels, allowing her to feel more calm and focused as she navigates this challenging situation. (Value: 9, Likelihood: 95)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negative Consequences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Physical Exhaustion**: Packing and preparing to move can be physically demanding, potentially leaving Dorothy exhausted and drained if she doesn't pace herself. (Value: -6, Likelihood: 60)\n",
      "2. **Emotional Overwhelm**: The task of packing up her entire life may become emotionally overwhelming for Dorothy, leading to feelings of sadness or anxiety. (Value: -8, Likelihood: 70)\n",

      "2. **Empathy from Alice**: If Dorothy breaks down emotionally, Alice may offer comfort and support, strengthening their friendship and providing emotional validation. (Value: 9, Likelihood: 90)\n",
      "3. **Re-evaluation of Priorities**: In the midst of emotional turmoil, Dorothy may re-evaluate her priorities and gain a fresh perspective on what's truly important to her, leading to positive changes in her life. (Value: 7, Likelihood: 70)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negative Consequences:**\n",
      "\n",

      "3. **Delayed Progress**: Emotional turmoil can distract Dorothy from her immediate goal of moving out of her house tonight, leading to delays and further complications. (Value: -9, Likelihood: 80)\n",

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",
