      "2. **Missed opportunities for bonding**: By setting boundaries, Alice may miss out on opportunities to bond with her friend and build memories together. This could lead to feelings of regret or FOMO (fear of missing out). (Value: -5, Likelihood: 20)\n",
      "3. **Damage to the friendship**: If Alice's boundaries are perceived as too strict or unreasonable, it could damage her friendship with Dorothy and create tension or conflict in their relationship. (Value: -8, Likelihood: 10)\n",

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.\n",
