      "[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] \n",
      "At the age of three, Alice was known for her mischievous antics, and one formative episode that showcased this aspect of her personality occurred when she \"accidentally\" knocked over a vase in the living room. While her parents were distracted by dinner preparations, Alice had snuck into the room and was playing with the vase, causing it to fall and shatter on the floor. When her parents entered the room and saw the mess, Alice feigned innocence and pretended that she had nothing to do with the broken vase. This episode demonstrated Alice's penchant for causing mischief and her ability to think on her feet to cover up her misdeeds.\n",
      "[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] \n",
      "At the age of seven, Alice was known for her adventurous spirit and love of mischief, and one formative episode that showcased this aspect of her personality occurred when she snuck into the local park with her friends Charlie and Dorothy. While playing on the swings, Alice decided to take a risk and climb up to the top of the tallest slide, despite the warnings from her friends. As she reached the top, the slide suddenly malfunctioned, causing Alice to slide down faster than expected and landing with a thud at the bottom. Although shaken, Alice was thrilled by the rush of adrenaline and the sense of adventure that came with taking risks. This episode demonstrated Alice's fearlessness and willingness to push boundaries, even at a young age.\n",
      "[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] \n",
      "At the age of twelve, Alice was known for her bold and daring nature, and one formative episode that showcased this aspect of her personality occurred when she convinced her friends to sneak into an abandoned house on the outskirts of town. While exploring the creepy and dilapidated structure, Alice discovered a hidden room filled with old and mysterious objects. As they began to explore the room, Alice noticed a strange glow emanating from one of the objects, which she soon realized was a magical crystal. Without hesitation, Alice grabbed the crystal and ran out of the house with her friends, narrowly avoiding the angry owner who had been alerted to their presence. This episode demonstrated Alice's fearlessness, curiosity, and willingness to take risks, even in the face of potential danger.\n",
      "[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] \n",
      "At the age of sixteen, Alice was known for her bold and daring nature, and one formative episode that showcased this aspect of her personality occurred when she convinced her friends to sneak into an exclusive party at a wealthy classmate's mansion. While mingling with the other guests, Alice spotted a rare and valuable necklace on display and decided to take it for herself. As she reached for the necklace, however, she was caught by the host's security team and forced to make a hasty escape. Undeterred, Alice and her friends snuck back into the party later that night and successfully stole the necklace, solidifying Alice's reputation as a fearless and cunning thief. This episode demonstrated Alice's willingness to take risks, her ability to think on her feet, and her determination to get what she wants, even if it means breaking the law.\n",
      "[03 Jul 2005 00:00:00] At the age of twenty-one, Alice was known for her bold and daring nature, and one formative episode that showcased this aspect of her personality occurred when she convinced her friends to join her on a high-stakes heist at a wealthy businessman's office building. As they made their way through the security system, Alice discovered a valuable and rare gemstone on display in the CEO's office. With her quick thinking and cunning, Alice managed to steal the gemstone and escape without getting caught, solidifying her reputation as a fearless and skilled thief. This episode demonstrated Alice's willingness to take risks, her ability to think on her feet, and her determination to get what she wants, even if it means breaking the law.\n",
